# Inkpotro
Inkpotro is a lightweight desktop application for bloggers and developers who use **Hugo**. With a beautiful interface and seamless local post generation, Inkpotro helps you focus on writing, not the workflow.

## Features
- Clean and structured post editor with YAML frontmatter
- Automatically fills in your GitHub name as author
- Organizes generated posts in standard **Hugo-compatible** format
- Powered by **Inksky**: our elegant, custom-built UI theme
- Fast, distraction-free experience, no browser required

## GitHub Integration
Inkpotro uses your **GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)** to personalize your writing environment.</br>The token is stored securely in:
* **Linux/macOS**
  
   * ```shell
      ~/.inkpotro/config/token.json
      ```
* **Windows**
  
   * ```shell
      C:\Users\YourUsername\.inkpotro\config\token.json
      ```

## Installation
### Windows
- Download the latest Inkpotro for Windows from the [**`Releases`**](https://github.com/inkpotro/inkpotro/releases) section.
- Double-click the `Inkpotro.exe` file.
- The app will run instantly, no installation or admin rights required.

### Linux
- Download the latest Linux AppImage from the [**`Releases`**](https://github.com/inkpotro/inkpotro/releases)
